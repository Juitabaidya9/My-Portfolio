## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a final-year Electrical Engineering student at NIT Agartala (2022–2026) with hands-on experience in power systems, PLC-based industrial automation, and IoT system development.

Alongside my electrical core knowledge, I actively build software solutions using Python, C++, and web technologies. I enjoy designing intelligent systems that combine control logic, hardware integration, and clean code to solve real-world engineering problems.
